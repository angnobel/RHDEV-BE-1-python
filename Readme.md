Hi Nobel,

1) I am done with the python code. I am not sure whether you want to mark it
based on aesthetics too so I tried to make it as close to your requirement
as possible.

2) I did not use the "Return" keyword in the processRequest(request) function.
Not sure whether it is wrong but I wanted to create a void function like that in
C.

3) Because of #2, I am unable to use the print(processRequest(request)) because it
will print out none on top of the list which is incorrect. Instead, I just called out
the function immediately.

Do let me know if you have any comments.
